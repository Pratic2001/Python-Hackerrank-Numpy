Task

You are given the coefficients of a polynomial .
Your task is to find the value of  at point .

Input Format

The first line contains the space separated value of the coefficients in P.
The second line contains the value of a.

Output Format

Print the desired value.

Sample Input

1.1 2 3
0
Sample Output

3.0


#Python Program:
P = list(map(float, input().split())
a = int(input())
print(numpy.polyval(p,x)) #This will evaluate the Polynomial at points P.And its formula is (f=(x**(l-i-1))*coeff[i]+f).
